# Advent-of-Cyber-2024

Welcome to my dedicated series for the Advent of Cyber 2024! As we embark on this exciting journey through the holiday-themed cybersecurity challenges, I will be uploading daily solutions to each task presented in the Advent of Cyber room on TryHackMe. This initiative aims to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to enhance their cybersecurity skills while enjoying the festive spirit.

Each day, I will tackle the new challenge released in the Advent of Cyber, offering detailed walkthroughs and explanations of my thought process. My goal is to break down complex concepts into manageable steps, making it easier for both beginners and experienced practitioners to grasp the material. From web application security to network analysis and cryptography, we will explore a wide range of topics that are essential in the cybersecurity field.
